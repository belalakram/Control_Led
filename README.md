# iot

A new Flutter project.

## About

To connect Embedded Linux (e.g., Jetson Nano) with a Flutter app for controlling an LED, you can create a backend service on the Linux device (like a REST API using Python Flask) that communicates with the GPIO pins, then have the Flutter app send HTTP requests to that service to control the LED.
